# paperbash

This is a package management tool for about everything, primarily bash scripts, but can configure and install about everything. Please be aware that it's not even near completion or first usable version

## installation

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperbenni/paperbash/master/setup.sh" > papersetup.sh; source papersetup.sh; rm papersetup.sh
```

## how to uninstall

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperbenni/paperbash/master/uninstall.sh" > paperuninstall.sh; source paperuninstall.sh; rm paperuninstall.sh
```

## I don't like working alone so new collaborators are always welcome
