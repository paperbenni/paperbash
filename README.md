# paperbash
This is a package management tool for about everything, primarily bash scripts, but can configure and install about everything. Please be aware that it's not even near completion or first usable version

# installation
```sh
curl -o install.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperbenni/paperbash/master/install.sh" > paperinstall.sh; source paperinstall.sh; rm paperinstall.sh
```
## I don't like working alone so new collaborators are always welcome
